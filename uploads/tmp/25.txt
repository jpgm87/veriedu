Once upon a time, there was a lumberjack who one day realized that his axe was 
missing. Surprised and with tears in his eyes, he saw his neighbor near his house — 
who, as always, greeted him with a warm and friendly smile. 
As the neighbor entered his home, the lumberjack suddenly began to suspect that 
perhaps it was the neighbor who had stolen the axe. In fact, now that he thought 
about it, his smile looked nervous, his eyes seemed strange, and he could have sworn 
his hands were shaking. On second thought, the neighbor had the same expression as a 
thief, walked like a thief, and even talked like a thief. 
All of this ran through the lumberjack’s mind, growing ever more certain that he had 
found the thief, when suddenly he realized that his steps had taken him back to the 
forest where he had been the night before. 
Suddenly, he tripped over something hard and fell. When he looked down... there was 
his axe! 
The lumberjack returned home with the axe, ashamed of his suspicions. And when he 
saw his neighbor again, he noticed that his expression, his walk, and his way of 
speaking were — and had always been — exactly the same as before.
